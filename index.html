    <h1>Why Mr.Adit Became a Teacher</h1>
    <h2>1. The Students</h2>
    <p>His first answer was'The Students'. He explained how he wanted to  educate the students with a real life problem. For example, making websites and games. Theese are skills and knowledge that are crucial for the near future. As a result, we as students have such skill useful for the real world.</p>
    <h2>2. Passion</h2>
    <p>Next, what motivated him was his passion towards teaching. "I became a teacher because I like to teach the others", he said. Him himself loves to learn and is able to teach Informatics, Physiscs, History and more! 
This shows how much he loves to share his knowledge and understandings to people.</p>
    <h2>3. Because He applied</h2>
    <p>...and he got the job!. At that time, he hasn't finished with college but took the risk anyways to apply to be a teacher in this school. Of course, after the process of tiring interviews and rigorous tests. The school decided to hire him as they were lacking a person in the ICT department.  </p>
